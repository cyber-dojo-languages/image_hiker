There are two arguments to image_hiker
o) the name of the start-point image
   Create the start-point image outside and
   pass in as an argument to image_hiker.
o) the name of the LTF image passed to the runner
   This is inside the start-points manifest.json file.
   Create this outside and pass in as an argument to image_hiker.

So image_hiker will be a docker-image that
o) has docker-compose inside it
o) is passed the names of
   1) the start-point image
   2) the LTF image (this will be inside the start-point too)
o) it will start a languages service from 1)
o) it will start a runner service
o) it will start a ragger service
o) it will...
   - get the starting-files from the language service
   - pass them to runner and get back stdout/stderr/status
   - pass sss to ragger and confirm red
   - s/6 * 9/6 * sdf/ and repeat, confirm an amber
   - s/6 * 9/6 * 7/ and repeat, confirm a green
